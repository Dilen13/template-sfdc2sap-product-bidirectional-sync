		<section id="use_case">
			This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online bi-directional synchronization of products/materials between Salesforce and SAP.
			Everytime there is a new product/material or a change in already existing one in Salesforce or SAP instance, the template will fetch it and send it as IDoc to SAP or Salesforce respectively to update product/material there.
			
			Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.
			
			As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
			The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
			The integration is triggered by poll to one of Salesforce Protucts or SAP Materials. New or modified products/materials are passed to the batch as input.
			In the batch the customer is fetched from SAP by Material Number or from Salesforce by its Product Code.
			Afterwards every such product/material is sent to destination instance - to Salesforce with Upsert or to SAP in form of iDoc XML where it is asynchronously updated or created.
			
			Both polls are executed mutually exclusively using shared lock.

**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies in oder to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, please continue reading.

You will find that there are three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id:

2. Create table type ZMULE_TT_MARA in transaction SE11 as per its definition in file table_type_ZMULE_TT_MARA.abap
3. Create message class called ZMULESOFTINTEGRATION in transaction SE91 as per definition in file msg_class_ZMULESOFTINTEGRATION.abap
4. Create function module ZMULE_MATERIAL_GETLIST in transaction SE37 as per source file ZMULE_MATERIAL_GETLIST.abap

		<section id="api_calls">
<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Products/Materials to be synchronized on each run.

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Products/Materials are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 API calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).
